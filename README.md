# Adult-Income-Prediction
We try to find if a person's income is more than 50K or not using various ML models
Here we try and experiment with different classification models namely:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Raandom Forests
- XGBoost
We first try out spliting the data into 7:3 ratio (train-test-split)
Then we try out 10 Fold Cross Validation to eradicate **Overfitting**
Then we try some hyper-parameter tuning to get the best possible result.
