# Adult-Income-Prediction
We try to find if a person's income is more than 50K or not using various ML models. This is done because in real world industry experimentation with models is widely practiced. Hence we try and experiment with different classification models namely:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forests
- XGBoost<br>

We first try out splitting the data into 7:3 ratio (train-test-split)<br>
Then we try out 10 Fold Cross Validation to eradicate **Overfitting**.<br>
Then we try some hyper-parameter tuning to get the best possible result.
